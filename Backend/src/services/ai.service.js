                        Evaluate the candidate's profile against the target job description to generate a detailed interview strategy and an objective match score.

                        Inputs:
                        - Candidate Resume: ${resume || "Not provided"}
                        - Candidate Self Description: ${selfDescription || "Not provided"}
                        - Job Description: ${jobDescription}

                        Calculation Guidelines for matchScore:
                        1. Start with a baseline score based on tech stack alignment (50%), experience level alignment (30%), and educational/general qualifications (20%).
                        2. Deduct marks objectively for any detected skill gaps in the candidate's profile:
                           - Deduct 15-20% for each HIGH-severity skill gap (a critical prerequisite technology or concept specified in the job description that is missing from the resume).
                           - Deduct 5-10% for each MEDIUM-severity skill gap (a preferred, secondary requirement or tool that is missing).
                           - Deduct 2-5% for each LOW-severity skill gap (minor/nice-to-have items).
                        3. Be realistic and honest: If a candidate has major skill gaps or has a completely unrelated background, the matchScore MUST be low (e.g., under 40%). Do not inflate scores. Give a professional, accurate assessment that matches real-world recruiter screening.
                        4. Ensure that the severity of gaps listed in your 'skillGaps' field aligns with the matchScore deduction (e.g., if you list 3 high severity gaps, the match score should reflect those heavy penalties).
